### Hi there 👋, I Emmanuel Eleam.
#### I basically speak to computers through code

I work as a software engineer, currently focused on __web development__, basically I develop the web that is if we are not talking about spider webs.  
Feel free to use some of my codes in your project, that is why it is a repository anyways.
